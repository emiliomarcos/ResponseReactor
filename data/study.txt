9. The main reason it's hard to figure out what to work on is that you can't truly know what most kinds of work are like until you actually do them. This is exacerbated by the nature of ambition, as there are two forms of ambition that can make it harder to decide.
10. To make yourself a big target for luck, you need to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, and ask lots of questions. By being open and curious, you increase your chances of stumbling upon opportunities and serendipitous encounters.
11. To optimize for interestingness when choosing what to work on, you should follow your own interests and tastes, even if they are different from other people's. The stranger your tastes, the stronger they are likely to be, and the more likely you are to find new and unique things.
12. The forces that can lead you astray when trying to figure out what to work on include societal expectations, educational systems that push you to commit to a field early on, and the assumption that everyone will magically guess what to do as a teenager. It's important to recognize that you are on your own in figuring out what to work on.

18. The advantage of being old and experienced in doing great work is that you have accumulated knowledge and expertise in a specific field. This allows you to delve deeper into the subject and make more informed and impactful contributions.
19. You can acquire new questions and ideas by constantly seeking out new experiences, meeting new people, reading extensively, and staying curious. By exposing yourself to different perspectives and domains, you can expand your knowledge and generate new ideas.

21. When you're young, you can make the most of your time by trying lots of things, meeting new people, and exploring different fields. Use your youth as an opportunity to gather diverse experiences and discover what truly excites you.
22. Making successive versions in doing great work allows you to iterate and improve upon your ideas. By continuously refining and evolving your work, you can make it better and closer to your vision.
