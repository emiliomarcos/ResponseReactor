Answers:
1. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: a natural aptitude, a deep interest, and the potential for great work.
2. It is often difficult to figure out what to work on because you can't truly know what most kinds of work are like until you actually do them. Additionally, the nature of ambition can make it harder to decide, as there are two forms of ambition that can either precede or grow out of interest in a subject.
3. The first step to figuring out what to work on is to start working. If you're not sure, guess and pick something to get started. You may guess wrong, but it's important to start somewhere and gain experience.
4. It is important to work on your own projects because if you manage to do great work, it will likely be on a project of your own. Working on your own projects allows you to have more control and drive your own part of the work.
5. Your projects should be whatever seems excitingly ambitious to you. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, what is exciting and what is important will converge. Always preserve the excitement and curiosity in your projects.
6. The four steps to doing great work are: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier of knowledge, notice gaps in the knowledge, and explore the promising gaps.
7. The three most powerful motives for doing great work are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. When these motives converge, it can be the most powerful combination.
8. To discover a new fractal bud, you need to notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and find a whole new world inside. This requires asking questions about things that others take for granted and being open to strange and outlier ideas.
9. The main reason it's hard to figure out what to work on is that you can't truly know what most kinds of work are like until you actually do them. This is exacerbated by the nature of ambition, as there are two forms of ambition that can make it harder to decide.
10. To make yourself a big target for luck, you need to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, and ask lots of questions. By being open and curious, you increase your chances of stumbling upon opportunities and serendipitous encounters.
11. To optimize for interestingness when choosing what to work on, you should follow your own interests and tastes, even if they are different from other people's. The stranger your tastes, the stronger they are likely to be, and the more likely you are to find new and unique things.
12. The forces that can lead you astray when trying to figure out what to work on include societal expectations, educational systems that push you to commit to a field early on, and the assumption that everyone will magically guess what to do as a teenager. It's important to recognize that you are on your own in figuring out what to work on.
13. Being earnest in doing great work is important because it drives you to work harder and be more dedicated. It is the combination of curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive that fuels great work.
14. To avoid affectation in your work, you should focus on being genuine and true to yourself. Don't try to manufacture strangeness or originality, but embrace it if it naturally appears in your work.
15. Questions play a crucial role in the composition of new ideas. By asking questions about things that others take for granted, you can uncover gaps in knowledge and explore new possibilities. Answers to these questions can lead to new discoveries and insights.
16. You can cultivate originality in your thinking by embracing outlier ideas and pursuing possibilities that others may not be interested in. By having expertise in a specific area and being able to identify what others are overlooking, you can make unique contributions and stand out.
17. The advantage of being young and inexperienced in doing great work is that you have the opportunity to explore and try different things. You have the freedom to be curious and open-minded without the constraints of preconceived notions or established expertise.
18. The advantage of being old and experienced in doing great work is that you have accumulated knowledge and expertise in a specific field. This allows you to delve deeper into the subject and make more informed and impactful contributions.
19. You can acquire new questions and ideas by constantly seeking out new experiences, meeting new people, reading extensively, and staying curious. By exposing yourself to different perspectives and domains, you can expand your knowledge and generate new ideas.
20. Being promiscuously curious in doing great work means being open to exploring a wide range of interests and topics. By being curious about many things, you increase your chances of stumbling upon unexpected connections and opportunities for great work.
21. When you're young, you can make the most of your time by trying lots of things, meeting new people, and exploring different fields. Use your youth as an opportunity to gather diverse experiences and discover what truly excites you.
22. Making successive versions in doing great work allows you to iterate and improve upon your ideas. By continuously refining and evolving your work, you can make it better and closer to your vision.
23. Planning is not as effective as starting small and evolving your work because plans often don't account for the unforeseen challenges and opportunities that arise during the process. By starting small and adapting as you go, you can be more flexible and responsive to changes.
24. The dangers of copying in doing great work are that it can lead to unoriginal and derivative work. Copying may limit your ability to think creatively and come up with unique ideas.
25. To avoid the dangers of copying and make your work original, you should focus on embracing your own interests and perspectives. By following your own curiosity and pursuing what genuinely excites you, you can create work that is authentic and original.
